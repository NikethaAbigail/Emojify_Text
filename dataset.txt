EmojifyText Dataset Info
=======================

What is this?
-------------
This is the dataset for the EmojifyText project‚Äîa collection of social media posts paired with 43 unique emojis (e.g., üòÇ, ‚ù§Ô∏è, üëâ). It‚Äôs packed into a file called `archive (2).zip`, which contains individual CSV files for each emoji, each with a 'Text' column of posts. This dataset powers the magic of predicting emojis from your text!

Where to Get It?
----------------
The dataset is too big for GitHub, so it‚Äôs hosted on Google Drive. Download it here:

1. Click the link above to access the file on Google Drive.
2. Click the "Download" button (you might need to sign in to Google, but no special permissions are required).
3. Save `archive (2).zip` to your computer.
4. Unzip it into the same folder as `emoji_predictor.ipynb` (the main notebook from this repo).
5. Open the notebook and run it‚Äîeverything should work smoothly with the dataset in place!

Notes:
------
- The unzipped folder will be named `data` and contain 43 CSV files (e.g., `red_heart.csv`, `thumbs_up.csv`).
- Make sure you have enough disk space (it‚Äôs a hefty file!).
